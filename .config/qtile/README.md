# Qtile config 

## Version
This configuration is for qtile version 0.14.2, the latest available in Fedora
repos as of 1/11/2021.
## Autostart
The `autostart.sh` file is used to set the wallpaper on boot. When creating a shell
script it must be made into an executable file. This can be done by:
```
$ chmod +x path/to/file
```
in our case,
```
$ chmod +x ~/.config/qtile/autostart.sh
```
